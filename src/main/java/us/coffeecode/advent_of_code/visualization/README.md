# Visualization Package

This package contains classes that present the user with the ability to run any test that is annotated to be visualized. This
means that instead of running an automated test that verifies the answer, it instead shows a visual result of the computation.

For now, this is limited to showing the results of computation as opposed to an animation of the computation in progress. However,
tests may show intermediate results and these will be shown to the user.
